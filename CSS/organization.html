<!-- When naming classes in HTML/CSS, we usually use simple names like header -button. 
 However, when we want to add a modifier to a class, we use two hyphens (e.g., button--border) instead of one,
  to clearly indicate that it is a modifier. This helps other developers understand the structure more easily.
   Apart from modifiers, we can also create elements within a block using two underscores, like header__button,
    where button is a part of the header block. This follows the BEM (Block Element Modifier) naming convention. 
    We can also apply multiple modifiers to a single class by adding them with spaces. In this case, 
    I've used header-button because the button is inside a block whose class is named header,
     so calling it header-button makes it clear and organized. If someone else looks at the code,
      they'll immediately understand that the button belongs to theÂ headerÂ section. -->
